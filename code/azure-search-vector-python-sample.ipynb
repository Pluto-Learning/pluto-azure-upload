This is particularly true inside buildings and within \\nclassrooms and labs where social distancing is impossible due to limited space. If a student needs accommodations to \\nensure social distancing in the classroom due to being at high risk, they are encouraged to work directly with the \\nStudent Access and Resource Center to assist in these accommodations. If students need masks, they may obtain them \\nat the Central Library, the E.H. Hereford University Center’s front desk, or in their department. \\nAttendance \\nAt The University of Texas at Arlington, taking attendance is not required, but attendance is a critical indicator of \\nstudent success. However, while UT Arlington does not require instructors to take attendance in their courses, the U.S. \\nDepartment of Education requires that the University have a mechanism in place to mark when Federal Student Aid \\nrecipients “begin attendance in a course.” UT Arlington instructors will report when students begin attendance in a \\ncourse as part of the final grading process. Specifically, when assigning a student a grade of F, the faculty report the last \\ndate a student attended their', 'category': 'Category'}, {'id': '11', 'title': 'Title for Chunk 11', 'content': ' class based on evidence such as a test, participation in a class project or presentation, or \\nan engagement online via Canvas.
