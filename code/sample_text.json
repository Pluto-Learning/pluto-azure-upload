Also, scores of new examples have been added, along with fresh \nConcepts & Connections illustrations, to make the content come alive and to provide \nstudents with a ringside view of strategy in action. The fundamental character of the \nsixth edition of Essentials of Strategic Management is very much in step with the best \nacademic thinking and contemporary management practice. The chapter content con-\ntinues to be solidly mainstream and balanced, mirroring both the penetrating insight of \nacademic thought and the pragmatism of real-world strategic management.\nComplementing the text presentation is a truly appealing lineup of 12 diverse, \ntimely, and thoughtfully crafted cases. All of the cases are tightly linked to the content \nof the 10 chapters, thus pushing students to apply the concepts and analytical tools \nthey have read about. Seven of the cases were written by the coauthors to illustrate spe-\ncific tools of analysis or distinct strategic management theories.

Incorporating a competition-based \nstrategy simulation has the strong appeal of providing class members with an immediate \nand engaging opportunity to apply the concepts and analytical tools covered in the chapters \nin a head-to-head competition with companies run by other class members. Two widely used \nand pedagogically effective online strategy simulations, The Business Strategy Game and \nGLO-BUS, are optional companions for this text. Both simulations, like the cases, are \nclosely linked to the content of each chapter in the text. The Exercises for Simulation \nParticipants, found at the end of each chapter, provide clear guidance to class members in \napplying the concepts and analytical tools covered in the chapters to the issues and deci-\nsions that they have to wrestle with in managing their simulation company.\nThrough our experiences as business school faculty members, we also fully under-\nstand the assessment demands on faculty teaching strategic management and business \nPreface  vii\npolicy courses.

Our integrated coverage of the two most popular perspectives on strategic management \npositioning theory and resource-based theory is unsurpassed by any other leading \nstrategy text.

Following Henry Mintzberg\u2019s pioneer-\ning research, we also stress why a company\u2019s strategy is partly planned and partly \nreactive and why this strategy tends to evolve.

Using both cases and \na strategy simulation to drill students in thinking strategically and applying what \nthey read in the text chapters is a stronger, more effective means of helping them \nconnect theory with practice and develop better business judgment.

Because they are held fully accountable for their decisions and their com-\npany\u2019s performance, co-managers are strongly motivated to dig deeply into company \noperations, probe for ways to be more cost-efficient and competitive, and ferret out \nstrategic moves and decisions calculated to boost company performance. Conse-\nquently, incorporating both case assignments and a strategy simulation to develop the \nskills of class members in thinking strategically and applying the concepts and tools of \nstrategic analysis turns out to be more pedagogically powerful than relying solely on \ncase assignments: there is stronger retention of the lessons learned and better achieve-\nment of course learning objectives.

Leadership and hard work are all very \nwell and luck is mighty useful, but it is strategy that makes or breaks a firm.\u201d1 Luck \nand circumstance can explain why some companies are blessed with initial, short-lived \nsuccess.

Companies such as Apple, Samsung, Disney, Emirates Airlines, Microsoft, \nAlphabet (formerly Google), Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric, and Southwest  \nAirlines come to mind.\nIn this opening chapter, we define the concept of strategy and describe its many \nfacets.

How well does the strategy fit the company\u2019s situ-\nation? To qualify as a winner, a strategy has to \nbe well matched to the company\u2019s external and \ninternal situations. The strategy must fit competi-\ntive conditions in the industry and other aspects of \nthe enterprise\u2019s external environment. At the same \ntime, it should be tailored to the company\u2019s collection of competitively important \nresources and capabilities. It\u2019s unwise to build a strategy upon the company\u2019s \nweaknesses or pursue a strategic approach that requires resources that are defi-\ncient in the company. Unless a strategy exhibits a tight fit with both the external \nand internal aspects of a company\u2019s overall situation, it is unlikely to produce \nrespectable, first-rate business results.\n 2. Is the strategy helping the company achieve a sustainable competitive advantage? \nStrategies that fail to achieve a durable competitive advantage over rivals are \nunlikely to produce superior performance",

Companies don\u2019t get to the top of the industry rankings or stay \nthere with illogical strategies, copycat strategies, or timid attempts to try to do better. \nAmong all the things managers do, nothing affects a company\u2019s ultimate success or \nfailure more fundamentally than how well its management team charts the company\u2019s \ndirection, develops competitively effective strategic moves and business approaches, \nand pursues what needs to be done internally to produce good day-in, day-out strategy \nexecution and operating excellence. Indeed, good strategy and good strategy execution \nare the most telling signs of good management. The rationale for using the twin stan-\ndards of good strategy making and good strategy execution to determine whether a \ncompany is well managed is therefore compelling: The better conceived a company\u2019s \nstrategy and the more competently it is executed, the more likely that the company will be \na standout performer in the marketplace. In stark contrast, a company that lacks clear-\ncut direction, has a flawed strategy, or cannot execute \nits strategy competently is a company whose financial \nperformance is probably suffering, whose business \nis at long-term risk, and whose management is sorely \nlacking.\nThe Road Ahead\nThroughout the chapters to come",

Buyers with strong bargaining power can limit industry profitabil-\nity by demanding price concessions, better payment terms, or additional features and \nservices that increase industry members\u2019 costs.

For instance, the producers of sugar experience competitive \npressures from the sales and marketing efforts of the makers of Splenda, Truvia, and \nSweet\u2019N Low. Similarly, cable television networks and providers are finding it more \ndifficult to maintain their relevance to subscribers who find greater value in streaming \ndevices and services.\nJust how strong the competitive pressures are from the sellers of substitute products \ndepends on three factors:\n 1. Whether substitutes are readily available and attractively priced. The presence of \nreadily available and attractively priced substitutes creates competitive pressure by \nplacing a ceiling on the prices industry members can charge. When substitutes are \ncheaper than an industry\u2019s product, industry members come under heavy competi-\ntive pressure to reduce their prices and find ways to absorb the price cuts with cost \nreductions.\n 2. Whether buyers view the substitutes as comparable or better in terms of quality, perfor-\nmance, and other relevant attributes. Customers are prone to compare performance \nand other attributes as well as price. For example, consumers have found smart-\nphones to be a superior substitute to digital cameras because of constant availabil-\nity of smartphones and superior",

Whether the costs that buyers incur in switching to the substitutes are high or low. \nHigh switching costs deter switching to substitutes, whereas low switching costs \nmake it easier for the sellers of attractive substitutes to lure buyers to their prod-\nucts. Typical switching costs include the inconvenience of switching to a substi-\ntute, the costs of additional equipment, the psychological costs of severing old \nsupplier relationships, and employee retraining costs.\nFigure 3.4 summarizes the conditions that determine whether the competitive pres-\nsures from substitute products are strong, moderate, or weak. As a rule, the lower \nthe price of substitutes, the higher their quality and performance, and the lower the \nuser\u2019s switching costs, the more intense the competitive pressures posed by substitute \nproducts.\nThe Competitive Force of Supplier Bargaining Power\nWhether the suppliers of industry members represent a weak or strong competitive \nforce depends on the degree to which suppliers have sufficient bargaining power to \ninfluence the terms and conditions of supply in their favor. Suppliers with strong bar-\ngaining power can erode industry profitability by charging industry members higher \nprices, passing costs on to them, and limiting their opportunities to find better deals. \nFor instance, Microsoft and Intel, both of which supply PC makers with essential com-\nponents, have been known to use their dominant market status not only to charge PC \nmakers premium prices but also to leverage PC makers in other ways.

Sometimes bench-\nmarking can be accomplished by collecting information from published reports, trade \ngroups, and industry research firms and by talking to knowledgeable industry ana-\nlysts, customers, and suppliers.

When companies engage in a value-creating \nactivity, they do so by drawing on specific company resources and capabilities that \nunderlie and enable the activity. For example, brand-building activities that enhance a \ncompany\u2019s customer value proposition can depend on human resources, such as experi-\nenced brand managers, as well as organizational capabilities related to developing and \nexecuting effective marketing campaigns.

One telling sign \nof whether a company\u2019s situation is strong or precarious is whether its costs are competi-\ntive with those of industry rivals. Another sign is how it compares with rivals in terms of \nits customer value proposition. Value chain analysis and benchmarking are essential tools \nin determining whether the company is performing particular functions and activities well, \nwhether its costs are in line with competitors, whether it is able to offer an attractive value \nproposition to customers, and whether particular internal activities and business processes \nneed improvement. Value chain analysis complements resource and capability analysis \nbecause of the tight linkage between activities and enabling resources and capabilities.\n 4. \nIs the company competitively stronger or weaker than key rivals? The key appraisals here \ninvolve how the company matches up against key rivals on industry key success factors and \nother chief determinants of competitive success and whether and why the company has \na competitive advantage or disadvantage. Quantitative competitive strength assessments, \nusing the method presented in Table 4.3, indicate where a company is competitively strong \nand weak and provide insight into the company\u2019s ability to defend or enhance its market \nposition",

A differentiation strategy \nkeyed to product or service attributes that are easily and quickly copied is always suspect. \nRapid imitation means that no rival achieves meaningful differentiation, because what-\never new feature one firm introduces that strikes the fancy of buyers is almost immedi-\nately added by rivals. This is why a firm must search out sources of uniqueness that are \ntime-consuming or burdensome for rivals to match if it hopes to use differentiation to \nwin a sustainable competitive edge over rivals.\nDifferentiation strategies can also falter when buyers see little value in the unique attri-\nbutes of a company\u2019s product.

Particular attention should be paid to cost drivers, \nwhich are factors having a strong effect on the cost of a company\u2019s value chain activities \nand cost structure.

To begin with, a \ncompany\u2019s in-house requirements are often too small to reach the optimum size for low-\ncost operation; for instance, if it takes a minimum production volume of 1 million units \nto achieve scale economies and a company\u2019s in-house requirements are just 250,000 units, \nthen it falls way short of being able to match the costs of outside suppliers (who may read-\nily find buyers for 1 million or more units).\nBut that said, there are still occasions when a company can improve its cost position \nand competitiveness by performing a broader range of value chain activities in-house rather \nthan having these activities performed by outside suppliers.

It is a conservative way to \ntest the international waters. The amount of capital needed to begin exporting is often \nquite minimal, and existing production capacity may be sufficient to make goods for \nexport. With an export-based entry strategy, a manufacturer can limit its involvement \nin foreign markets by contracting with foreign wholesalers experienced in importing to \nhandle the entire distribution and marketing function in their countries or regions of \nthe world. If it is more advantageous to maintain control over these functions, however, \na manufacturer can establish its own distribution and sales organizations in some or all \nof the target foreign markets. Either way, a home-based production and export strategy \nhelps the firm minimize its direct investments in foreign countries.\nAn export strategy is vulnerable when (1) manufacturing costs in the home country \nare substantially higher than in foreign countries where rivals have plants, (2) the costs \nof shipping the product to distant foreign markets are relatively high, or (3) adverse \nshifts occur in currency exchange rates. Unless an exporter can both keep its produc-\ntion and shipping costs competitive with rivals and successfully hedge against unfavor-\nable changes in currency exchange rates, its success will be limited.\nLicensing Strategies\nLicensing as an entry strategy makes sense when a firm with valuable technical know-\nhow or a unique patented product has neither the internal organizational capability nor",

One, it can use location to lower costs or help achieve greater product \ndifferentiation. And two, it can use cross-border coordination in ways that a domestic-\nonly competitor cannot.\nUsing Location to Build Competitive Advantage\nTo use location to build competitive advantage, a company must consider two issues: \n(1) whether to concentrate each internal process in a few countries or to disperse per-\nformance of each process to many nations, and (2) in which countries to locate particu-\nlar activities.\nWhen to Concentrate Internal Processes in a Few Locations Companies \ntend to concentrate their activities in a limited number of locations in the following \ncircumstances:\n \u2022 When the costs of manufacturing or other activities are significantly lower in some geo-\ngraphic locations than in others. For example, much of the world\u2019s athletic footwear \nis manufactured in Asia (China and Korea) because of low labor costs; much of \nthe production of circuit boards for PCs is located",

The presence of significant economies \nof scale in components production or final assembly means a company can gain \nmajor cost savings from operating a few superefficient plants as opposed to a host \nof small plants scattered across the world. Makers of digital cameras and LED \nTVs located in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have used their scale economies \nto establish a low-cost advantage.\n \u2022 When there is a steep learning curve associated with performing an activity. In some \nindustries, learning-curve effects in parts manufacture or assembly are so great \nthat a company establishes one or two large plants from which it serves the world \nmarket. The key to riding down the learning curve is to concentrate production in \na few locations to increase the accumulated volume at a plant (and thus the experi-\nence of the plant\u2019s workforce) as rapidly as possible.\n \u2022 When certain locations have superior resources, allow better coordination of related \nactivities, or offer other valuable advantages.

Buyer-related activities, such as distribution to dealers, sales and \nadvertising, and after-sale service, usually must take place close to buyers. This makes it \nnecessary to physically locate the capability to perform such activities in every country \nmarket where a global firm has major customers. For example, large public accounting \nfirms have numerous international offices to service the foreign operations of their \nmultinational corporate clients. Dispersing activities to many locations is also com-\npetitively important when high transportation costs, diseconomies of large size, and \ntrade barriers make it too expensive to operate from a central location. In addition, it is \nstrategically advantageous to disperse activities to hedge against the risks of fluctuating \nexchange rates and adverse political developments.\nUsing Cross-Border Coordination to  \nBuild Competitive Advantage\nMultinational and global competitors are able to coordinate activities across different \ncountries to build competitive advantage.14 If a firm learns how to assemble its product \nmore efficiently at, say, its Brazilian plant, the accumulated expertise and knowledge \ncan be shared with assembly plants in other world locations.

However, a company\u2019s \nopportunities for growth can become limited if the industry becomes competitively \nunattractive. Consider, for example, what mobile phone companies and marketers of \nVoice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) have done to the revenues of long-distance provid-\ners such as AT&T, British Telecommunications, and NTT in Japan. Thus, diversifying \ninto new industries always merits strong consideration whenever a single-business company \nencounters diminishing market opportunities and stagnating sales in its principal business.1\nBuilding Shareholder Value: The Ultimate \nJustification for Business Diversification\nDiversification must do more for a company than simply spread its business risk across \nvarious industries. In principle, diversification cannot be considered a success unless it \nresults in added shareholder value\u2014value that shareholders cannot capture on their own \nby spreading their investments across the stocks of companies in different industries.\nBusiness diversification stands little chance of building shareholder value without \npassing the following three tests:2\n 1.

The cost to enter the target industry must not be so high as \nto erode the potential for good profitability. A catch-22 can prevail here, however. \nThe more attractive an industry\u2019s prospects are for growth and good long-term \nprofitability, the more expensive it can be to enter. It\u2019s easy for acquisitions of \ncompanies in highly attractive industries to fail the cost-of-entry test.\n 3. The better-off test. Diversifying into a new business must offer potential for the com-\npany\u2019s existing businesses and the new business to perform better together under \na single corporate umbrella than they would perform operating as independent, \nstandalone businesses. For example, let\u2019s say company A diversifies by purchasing \ncompany B in another industry. If A and B\u2019s consolidated profits in the years to \ncome prove no greater than what each could have earned on its own, then A\u2019s diver-\nsification will not provide its shareholders with added \nvalue.

Generally, forming a startup subsidiary to enter a new business \nhas appeal only when (1) the parent company already has in-house most or all of the \nskills and resources needed to compete effectively; (2) there is ample time to launch the \nbusiness; (3) internal entry has lower costs than entry via acquisition; (4) the targeted \nindustry is populated with many relatively small firms such that the new startup does \nnot have to compete against large, powerful rivals; (5) adding new production capacity \nwill not adversely impact the supply\u2013demand balance in the industry; and (6) incum-\nbent firms are likely to be slow or ineffective in responding to a new entrant\u2019s efforts to \ncrack the market.\nUsing Joint Ventures to Achieve Diversification\nA joint venture to enter a new business can be useful in at least two types of situations.4 \nFirst, a joint venture is a good vehicle for pursuing an opportunity that is too com-\nplex, uneconomical, or risky for one company to pursue alone.

Moreover, from a global markets perspective, ethical relativism \nresults in a maze of conflicting ethical standards for multinational companies.

        "content": " challenge of making corrective adjustments is twofold: deciding when \nadjustments are needed and deciding what adjustments to make. Both decisions are a \nnormal and necessary part of managing the strategic management process, since no \nscheme for implementing and executing strategy can foresee all the events and prob-\nlems that will arise.31 There comes a time at every company when managers have to \nfine-tune or overhaul the company\u2019s strategy or its approaches to strategy execution \nand push for better results. Clearly, when a company\u2019s strategy or its execution efforts \nare not delivering good results, it is the leader\u2019s responsibility to step forward and push \ncorrective actions.\nKEY POINTS\nImplementing and executing strategy is an operations-driven activity revolving around the man-\nagement of people and business processes. The managerial emphasis is on converting strategic \nplans into actions and good results. Management\u2019s handling of the process of implementing and \nexecuting the chosen strategy can be considered successful if and when the company achieves the \ntargeted strategic and financial performance and shows good progress in making its strategic vision \na reality.\nLike crafting strategy, executing strategy is a job for a company\u2019s whole management team, \nnot just a few senior managers. Top-level managers have to rely on the active support and coop-\neration of middle and lower-level managers to push strategy changes into functional areas and \noperating units, and to see that the organization actually operates in accordance with the strat-\negy on a daily basis.\nEight managerial tasks",

These \ndesigns could be from in-house designers, who used \ncurrent trends, including fashion on display at fashion \nshows, to anticipate consumers\u2019 preferences.

Mycoskie attributed his \nsuccess during the recession to two factors: (1) As \nconsumers became more conscious of their spend-\ning during recessions, products like TOMS that gave \nto others actually became more appealing (accord-\ning to Mycoskie); (2) the giving model that TOMS \nemployed is not \u201cpriced in.\u201d Rather than commit a \npercentage of profits or revenues to charity, Mycoskie \nnoted that TOMS simply gave away a pair for every \npair it sold. This way, socially conscious consumers \nknew exactly where their money was going without \nhaving to worry that TOMS would cut back on its \ncharity efforts in order to turn a profit.15\nProduction at TOMS\nAlthough TOMS manufactured shoes in Argentina, \nEthiopia, and China, only shoes made in China were \nbrought to the retail market. Shoes made in Argen-\ntina and Ethiopia were strictly used for donation pur-\nposes. TOMS retailed its basic alpargata shoes in the \n$50 price range, even though the cost of producing \neach pair was estimated at around $9.16 Estimates for \nthe costs of producing TOMS\u2019s more expensive lines \nof shoes were unknown, but they retailed for upwards \nof $150.\nIn comparison, manufacturing the average pair of \nNike shoes in Indonesia cost around $20, and they \nwere priced",

More detailed \ninformation on trends in TOMS\u2019s production costs \nand practices is limited due to the private nature of \nthe company.\nThe Future\nBecause demand and revenues were predicted to \nincrease in the global footwear manufacturing indus-\ntry, incumbents like TOMS needed to find ways to \ndefend their position in the market. One method was \nto continue to differentiate products based on qual-\nity, image, or price. Another strategy was to focus \non research and development (R&D) and craft new \nbrands and product lines that appealed to different \naudiences. It was also recommended that compan-\nies investigate how to mitigate the threat posed by an \nincrease in supply costs.\nIn an effort to broaden its mission and product \nofferings, TOMS began to expand both its consumer \nbase and charitable-giving product lines. For its cus-\ntomers, TOMS started offering stylish wedges, ballet \nflats, and even wedding apparel in an effort to reach \nmore customers and satisfy the special needs of cur-\nrent ones. For the children it sought to help, TOMS \nexpanded past its basic black canvas shoe offerings \nto winter boots to help keep children\u2019s feet dry and \nwarm during the winter months in cold climate \ncountries.\nOn",
